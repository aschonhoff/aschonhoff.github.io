Hello and welcome. This site is designed to be a repository for myself and any others seeking to expand their knowledge and skillset as it relates to leveraging Python for data analytics and data science. The posts here are meant to serve as a reference point for getting up and running with using Python to clean, manipulate and extract findings from data sets.

This website will contain both old posts from my previous site and new posts as I continue to document the tips, techniques, and libraries. So check back in the future.

From this site you can also check out my [Github page](https://github.com/aschonhoff/aschonhoff.github.io) where I host this site, along with the Jupyter Notebooks I use to generate the content contained within. Additionally, if you want to know more about me you can find out about my work history, skillsets and education in the [About Me](/about) tab.

This site was built using the [Alembic theme](https://alembic.darn.es/) developed by David Darnes and is hosted for free on Github.
