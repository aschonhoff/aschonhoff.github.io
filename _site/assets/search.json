When it is ready you will need to write it to an html file.\n\npio.write_html(fig, file='name-of-your-file.html', auto_open=True)\n\nThe auto_open argument opens the file in your browser from where it is saved. Unfortunately, github pages do not allow for iframes to be used. Instead we can insert images, doing so will require having an images folder as part of your site structure along kaleido as part of your python package.\n\n fig.write_image('images/name-of-your-image.png') \n\nWhile, we cannot embed interactive iframes within github pages, we can insert static images:\n\n(fix later)\n\nAnd additionally, link to the interactive html chart:\n\nInteractive Covid Case Numbers for United States\n",
