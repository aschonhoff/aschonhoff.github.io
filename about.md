I'm a Colorado based data analyst, evaluator and technology enthusiast constantly seeking knowledge for personal and professional growth. This page contains a summary of my experience, interests and skills.

### About Me
As an evaluator at [Joining Vision and Action](https://joiningvisionandaction.com/), I help tell the story of the work being done by our clients and their affect on the communities they serve. My role on the evaluation team is primarily focused on finding ways to identify, collect and analyze data that can speak to the outcomes of the nonprofit organizations and government entities we serve.

In my free time I enjoy strumming my guitar, fishing, building and painting scale models and exploring all that Colorado has to offer. I am an avid learner and enjoy teaching myself how the technologies that power our world work. From opening up computers and phones to see if I can fix them to teaching myself the technologies that power and host this website, I am always seeking to expand my knowledge.

## Work Experience
### _Joining Vision and Action_
Research and Evaluation Associate â€¢ April 2016 - Present

As an evaluation associate my job is to work with clients to help them tell the story of the work they do. This involves:
  * Identifying the data that speaks to outcomes.
  * Developing the tools to collect identified data.
  * Analyze the data sets, both large and small, using a variety of statistical tests to identify salient data points.
  * Determine the best way to visualize the data to convey the findings.

As each clients needs and situations are different, my role requires creativity and problem solving to create the best solutions. Whether it is designing automated systems for data analysis and visualization or creating data collection systems with minimal recurring costs for non-profit clients, it is always a challenge and an opportunity to learn. I also serve as the primary trainer on the evaluation team facilitating the evaluation team's regularly scheduled and customized trainings.
