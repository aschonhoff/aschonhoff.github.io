# Starter kit for [Alembic](https://alembic.darn.es/)

This is my personal site. It started from the [Alembic theme](https://alembic.darn.es/)
developed by David Darnes.

With this site I intend to create a repository for myself and anyone else who is interested about the techniques I often use or the techniques I have taught myself
to leverage python for data analysis.
